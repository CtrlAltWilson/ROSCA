<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Support is now increasing the client support experience with an online chat interface. During business hours, clients will be able to interact with the support through the chat; if it's during after hours, a bot will provide the proper links to the knowledge base articles based on the description of the issue.


<h1>Bot
<h5>Introducing Raptor's Online Service Chat Assistance (ROSCA). Raptor's rapidly evolving bot that will be able to grab specific keywords and attempts to solve the client's issue. I have built this bot to understand and grow with phrases given to it by clients. You can say hi to it and it'll say hi back. You can demand an agent or ask for billing and it knows where to direct you.


<h1>How it works
<h5>Using multiple scripting modules, I am able to route the communication from the start to the end of the chat. ROSCA in design is set to pay attention to certain keywords from the client's description of the issue and pull any articles that contain those keywords. ROSCA is continually growing and have already solved a big portion of support's cases.


<h1>Notes and Updates
<h5>-Originally it requests for Name, Email, and Phone number. Now, we have it to pull the data of the client already logged in and automatically send that data to the next agent in queue.

<h5>-ROSCA channels clients through a double funnel system which puts them into prequeue before the actual queue. This allows them to submit a ticket if the wait is too long.

<h5>-ROSCA now logs and automate combined logs for total solved by ROSCA, total sent to agents, and total overall.
